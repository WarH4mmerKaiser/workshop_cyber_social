# WORKSHOP CYBERSECURITY, FOCUS ON SOCIAL ENGINEERING

## REQUIREMENTS

### Material requirement :
    - operational computer

### IT requirement :
    - windows dump;com
    - kali linux virtual machine installed on this windows dump (tuto to install kali virtual machine : https://wwww.youtube.com/the_vid)

IMPORTANT : be sure to be able to connect your virtual machine to wifi by testing it before the workshop

On your virtual kali, you'll need some tools :
    - 'msfvenom'
    - 'msfconsole'
    - 'set' (for 'social engineering toolkit')

IMPORTANT : all of those tools are normaly pre-installed on your dump, if it's not the case please go to 'TOOLS-INSTALLATION.md' on this repo and don't forget to test the correct installation of these tools by starting them in terminal before the workshop

For the target research, you can install facultative OSINT tools of your choice, here's a cool one :
    - 'mr.holmes' (see 'TOOLS-INSTLLATION.md')

# Skills requirement :
    - there is no skill required for this workshop, you'll learn to manipulate open-source tools so you'll not code a lot !

## WORKSHOP

To understand how an attack using social engineering works, we're gonna simulate one !
So this is the steps we'll follow :

    - research of a potential target according to the attack we want to do (using OSINT)
    - creation of a credible mail
    - creation of the attack items (see 'ATTACK-CREATION.md')
    - by making groups of 2, you'll test your malwares on your duo computer (don't worry, if the rules are respected there's no risks for your computer !)

### DISCLAIMER

By participating to this workshop, you agree to do and only do the things indicated in this workshop.
Your responsability will be engaged if you decide to do anything that could harm somebody else computer or integrity, especialy during the testing phase.
Moreover, if you don't want to let someone test his malware on your computer, let me know and we'll find another solution to test your malwares.
